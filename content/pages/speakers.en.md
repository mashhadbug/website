# Speakers

Mashhad*BUG welcomes speakers of all experience levels to present topics
of interest. There is no matter how technical (and not technical) the
topics are. The only thing we do not accept is presentations with sales
pitches or focused on proprietary softwares. We are all volunteers and
we intend to make our meetings a hup for professionals to meet others
and a way to effectively grow the open source community and we like the
attendees to respect that either.

# Slides

We recommend the speakers to **prepare slide** for their talks. ALso it
is wise to **upload the side online** before attending the meeting.
Also:

- Show up early at the meeting to test your laptop's hardware
compatibility and prepare for the presentation.
- Design the side with screen resolution of no more than 800x600. It
may not look properly when presenting through a projector..
- Limit the number of lines, fonts, colors and visual effects on your
slide. It may not look properly when presenting through a projector.
- The slides shouldn't say everything you will. Include only the
important lines in your slide.
- Check spelling grammer.

# general Tips

There are a lot of great resources on how to make a presentation and how
to present them. We encourage you to look up them on the Internet, but
here's a few ones:

- Plan carefully.
- Do your research.
- Know your audience.
- Time your presentation.
- Speak comfortably and clearly.
- Check the spelling and grammar.
- Do not read the presentation. Practice the presentation so you can
speak from bullet points. ...
- Give a brief overview at the start. Then present the information.
