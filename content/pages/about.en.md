people who enjoy using microcomputers or personal computers and who meet

# About BSD

> Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) is a Unix operating system
derivative developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research
Group (CSRG) of the University of California, Berkeley, from 1977 to
1995. Today the term "BSD" is often used non-specifically to refer to
any of the BSD descendants which together form a branch of the family of
Unix-like operating systems. Operating systems derived from the original
BSD code remain actively developed and widely used.
